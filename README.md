# redi.sh

Redi.sh is a primitive Redis client, written entirely in Bash. It allows you to read/write keys and sets from redis as if they were regular Bash variables.

## Usage:

> By default redi.sh reads input from stdin and interprets it as a variable or array (if -a is used). To avoid setting redis hostname and port number with each command, you can export REDIS_HOST and REDIS_PORT variables.

```
./redi.sh [-a] [-w] [-g <variable|array>] [-p <password>] [-H <hostname>] [-P <port>]

    -a              : Tells the script that we are working with arrays, instead of regular variables.
    -w              : Input as raw instead of read line by line, don't replace "\n" as 0x0a.
    -r <min,max>    : When used with -a, defines the range of elements to get from the array. Default is all (0,-1).
    -g <name>       : Get the variable/array specified by <name> and output it to stdout.
    -s <name>       : Set the variable/array specified by <name> with the input from stdin.
    -S <name>       : RPUSH command. This also set -a -s.
    -G <name>       : BLPOP command, the timeout is 0. This also set -g, overrides -a, they are mutually exclusive.
    -p <password>   : Use "AUTH <password>" before running the SET/GET command to authenticate to redis.
    -H <hostname>   : Specify a custom hostname to connect to. Default is localhost.
    -d <number>     : Specify a custom database number from range 0-15\. Default is 0
    -P <port>       : Specify a custom port to connect to. Default is 6379.
```

## Example:

```shell
$ echo "this is a variable" | ./redi.sh -s testvar
$ ./redi.sh -g testvar
this is a variable
```

```shell
$ echo red green blue | ./redi.sh -as Colors
$ ./redi.sh -ag Colors
red
green
blue
```

```shell
$ echo yellow | ./redi.sh -as queue
$ ./redi.sh -ag queue
yellow
$ echo red green blue | ./redi.sh -S queue
$ ./redi.sh -ag queue
yellow
red
green
blue
```

```shell
$ ./redi.sh -G queue
queue
yellow
```
